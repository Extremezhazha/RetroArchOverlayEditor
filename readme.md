# RetroArch Overlay Editor

This project was originally something I wrote in a week to see if I could and to make the overlay for Mu, it had a terrible static GUI and could only handle single layer float based overlays with buttons mapped to images and no background.

It currently supports, float overlays, auto conversion of int based overlays to float based overlays, a normal GUI with dropdown menus, loading and saving of overlays, adding and deleting buttons and joysticks, changing object IDs, changing/removing object images, objects with or without images attached, scaling and group resizing, single or multiple layer overlays, layer backgrounds, an image background to simulate a game output and much more.
