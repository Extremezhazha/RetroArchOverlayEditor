Cant change alpha channel and range mods for layers(per object is supported)
"overlay%u_desc%u_saturate_pct" not supported
overlay*_rect is unsupported
overlay*_desc*_normalized is not supported
Object images should be saved to the directory with the overlay file on saveToFile
overlay*_desc*_next_target is unsupported
overlay*_desc*_movable was loaded but not saved
new layers have invalid object indexes preventing RetroArch from loading them
Mouse is messed up after screen size change
"Save" button dosent save
Overlay backgrounds are not saved
box-psx for iPad dosent load properly(all overlays where being treated as int based)
Cant add or delete layers
loadFromFile should convert int overlays to float overlays
