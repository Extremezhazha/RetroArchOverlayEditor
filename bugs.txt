"Save As" also has an unknown issue
overlay*_name is unsupported
overlay*_desc*_next_target is unsupported
overlay*_desc*_pct is unsupported
overlay*_full_screen = false is unsupported
overlay*_rect is unsupported
Cant change alpha channel and range mods
Unknown varibles are deleted on save
Object images should be saved to the directory with the overlay file on saveToFile

Fixed:
Mouse is messed up after screen size change
"Save" button dosent save
Overlay backgrounds are not saved
box-psx for iPad dosent load properly(all overlays where being treated as int based)
Cant add or delete layers
loadFromFile should convert int overlays to float overlays
Cant move objects on layers other than 0
Layer backgrounds are unimplemented
